# Secret Santa

I created this project for all the friends of the secret santa tradition on christmas.

<br>

With this application you will be able to send nicknames from a user list (to be specified by yourself) anonymously to another user within the same user list.
The "giving" person will receive a persons name to get a gift for ("receiving" person). <br>
You can modify each user set, but also create new secret santa rules to make the tradition more usable for specific use cases easily via java.
The messages will be sent via email - please create a fun email address (from your email provider) that nobody of your friends knows to make it really anonymously!

`Note that you have to change those properties in class` [ApplicationStarter.java](https://github.com/maxjaen/java-secretsanta/blob/main/src/main/java/secretsanta/ApplicationStarter.java) `for individual usage`
