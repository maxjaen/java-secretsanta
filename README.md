# Secret Santa

- I created this project mainly because of the secret santa tradition on christmas.
- Features:
  - Modify users and secret santa rules easily via java
  - Create own rules for giver and receiver
  - Send individual message via email to givers's email address with receivers name anonymously
  
> Note that you have to change those properties in class [ApplicationStarter.java](https://github.com/maxjaen/java-secretsanta/blob/main/src/main/java/secretsanta/ApplicationStarter.java) for individual usage
