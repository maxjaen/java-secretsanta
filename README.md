# Secret Santa

- I created this project mainly because of the secret santa tradition on christmas.
- Features:
  - Modify personal, sender email address, recipient list etc. easily via java
  - Create own rules for sender and recipient
  - Send individual message via email to sender's email address with recipients nickname anonymously
  
> Note that you have to change those properties in class [Application.java](https://github.com/maxjaen/java-secretsanta/blob/main/src/main/java/secretsanta/Application.java) for individual usage
