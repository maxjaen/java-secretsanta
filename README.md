# Secret Santa

I developed this project for all those who celebrate the Secret Santa tradition during Christmas.

With this application, you will have the ability to anonymously send a nickname from a user list (to be specified by you) to another user within the same list. The "giving" person will receive the name of the person for whom they will be buying a gift ("receiving" person).

You can modify each user set and create new Secret Santa rules with ease via Java, making it more adaptable for specific use cases. The messages will be sent via email, so please create a unique email address (from your email provider) that is unknown to your friends, ensuring true anonymity.

Please note that you must modify the properties in the ApplicationStarter.java class for individual use.
